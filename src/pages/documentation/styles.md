## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to write more concise and maintainable CSS code. Tailwind focuses on providing low-level utility classes that can be combined to create custom components.

Tailwind CSS generates CSS code using a combination of configuration files, JavaScript, and PostCSS plugins.

## CSS generation

For this starter project, CSS generation is managed by eleventy.js.

In [windty](https://github.com/distantcam/windty), the previous starter,  css was generated with a separate run script in packages.json. The default `npm start` was triggering both 11ty and tailwind generation. The Postcss configuration was in a separate file.

I moved the css generation directly to the `eleventy.js` config file. It still uses Postcss. The tailwind configuration remains in `tailwind.config.js`.

Here is what processes the styles in `eleventy.js`:

```js
const postcssFilter = (cssCode, done) => {
  postCss([
    require('postcss-import'),
    tailwind(require('./tailwind.config')),
    autoprefixer(),
  ])
    .process(cssCode, {
      from: './src/_assets/css/styles.css'
    })
    .then(
      (r) => done(null, r.css),
      (e) => done(e, null)
    );
}
```

This configuration was inspired by the blog post [How to Integrate PostCSS and Tailwind CSS](https://zenzes.me/eleventy-integrate-postcss-and-tailwind-css/).

## Tailwind and Markdown

Tailwind CSS is ideal to use in html files, but markdown doesn't support tailwind snippets. For this, the blog post [Eleventy, Markdown, and Tailwind CSS](https://dev.to/matthewtole/eleventy-markdown-and-tailwind-css-14f8) proposes two solutions: *Create custom Tailwind components* and *add classes to the Markdown output*. The first solution was chosen that will help markdown files to focus on content.

Here are the styles used by markdown pages in this starter:

```css
@layer components {
  .mkdn h2 {
    @apply mt-8 mb-6 text-left text-2xl font-bold leading-tight text-indigo-800
  }
  .mkdn h3 {
    @apply my-4 text-left text-xl font-bold leading-normal text-blue-950
  }
  .mkdn p {
    @apply my-4 text-xl font-light leading-6 text-slate-900
  }
  …
}
```

### Additional markdown styles

In addition, the markdown-it-attrs plugins allows for additional classes to be added to the markdown output. This allows to style the note above within the same layer component.

```css
  .mkdn .note {
    @apply text-cyan-900 bg-sky-200 border p-4 border-cyan-900 border-l-8
    before:content-['ⓘ_Note:_'] before:font-bold
  }
```

The `markdown-it-attrs` plugin is simply added to the call for the markdown parser `markdown-it` that is loaded in `eleventy.js`.

```js
const mdit = require('markdown-it')
const mditAttrs = require('markdown-it-attrs');
const mditHighlight = require('markdown-it-highlightjs');

module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
  const mditOptions = {
    html: true,
    breaks: true,
    linkify: true,
    typographer: true,
  }
  const mdLib = mdit(mditOptions).use(mditAttrs).use(mditHighlight, { inline: true }).disable('code')
  eleventyConfig.setLibrary('md', mdLib)
}
```
